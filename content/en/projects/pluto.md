Pluto Web App is one of the products of <a href="https://arnika.ai" target="_blank">Arnika Design Consulting Engineers</a> which operates in the field of risk and asset management.

This project is based on <a href="https://nuxtjs.org" target="_blank">NuxtJS</a> and <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com" target="_blank">Vuetify< /a>.

To design Pluto's home page animations, I took the example of [Github Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise) and tried to give a new feeling to the landing page while being loyal to the company's branding.

You can see the live version of <a href="https://aides.stage.arnika.ai" target="_blank">Pluto</a> here.
