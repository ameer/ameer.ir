One of the interesting projects that I worked on in <a href="https://arnika.ai" target="_blank">Arnika Design Consulting Engineers</a> company was the Tardigrade project.

Tardigrade, recently renamed Keywa, is a crypto-based enterprise wallet that aims to help organizations manage their transactions and finances with crypto.

I developed the landing page and dashboard using <a href="https://nuxtjs.org" target="_blank">NuxtJS</a> and <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com" target="_blank">Vuetify</a>.

One of the important challenges that I was involved with during the development of the Tardigrade panel was the issue of drawing an organizational signature graph, which I was able to solve using the <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/" target="_blank">VisJS</a> library. You can see an example of it in the last slide.

Unfortunately, the live version of Tardigrade is not available, but you can see its full image here:
